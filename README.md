A Galois Systemizer Generator written on Python that outputs verilog code based on the user requierments.

Project based off the work done on Solving large systems of linear equations over GF(2) on FPGAs: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7857188

Usage:
```
python systemizer.py -n 4 -m 3 -l 16 -k 24 --genFullSystem --verify

```
This will create a systemizer with an array of 4x4 and the matrix to be solver has a size of 16x24. It will generate the Verilog files needed and verify that it works correctly.

```
python systemizer.py -n 4 -m 1013 -l 16 -k 24 --genFullSystem --verify --matrix matrix.txt 

```
Same as the one above but now it gets as an input a matrix found in the root directory named matrix.txt

Arguments: 

-n = Array Size 

-m = Finite Field (GF(m)) 

-l = Amount of rows in the matrix (lowercase L)

-k = Amount of column in the matrix 

--genFullSystem = Generates all needed verilog files plus a makefile for simulation 

--verify = runs a check on the output files generated by the system 

--matrix = Allows the user to pass a matrix stores in a CVS or .txt format.
