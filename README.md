A Galois Systemizer Generator written on Python that outputs verilog code based on the user requierments.

The system will generate different systems depending on the field provided by the user. 
The three posible variables are:
- GF(2)
- GF(2^q) for any q > 1
- GF (p) where p is prime

GF(p) tend to have worst frequencies due to long addition/multiplication chains. 
Project based off the work done on Solving large systems of linear equations over GF(2) on FPGAs: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7857188

### Prerequisites

```
pip install numpy
sudo apt-get iverilog
```

### Usage:
```
python systemizer.py -n 4 -m 3 -l 16 -k 24 --genFullSystem --verify

```
This will create a systemizer with an array of 4x4 and the matrix to be solver has a size of 16x24. It will generate the Verilog files needed and verify that it works correctly.

```
python systemizer.py -n 4 -m 1013 -l 16 -k 24 --genFullSystem --verify --matrix matrix.txt 

```
Same as the one above but now it gets as an input a matrix found in the root directory named matrix.txt

### Arguments: 

| Argument        | Function                                                          |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| -n              | Array Size                                                        |
| -m              | Finite Field (GF(m))                                              |
| -l              | Rows (lowercase L)                                                |
| -k              | Cols                                                              |
| --genFullSystem | Generates all needed verilog files plus a makefile for simulation |
| --verify        | Runs a check on the output files generated by the system          |
| --matrix        | Allows the user to pass a matrix stored in a CVS or .txt format.  |


### NOTES
- As the system is created, a makefile is also generated to allow running the system.
- If you wish to use the generated files, you must get everything in the `gen_verilog` and `inc` folders.


### TO-DO

- [ ] Better frequencies for prime fields by pipelining the design

- [ ] Adding Early Abort

- [ ] Memory Interface
